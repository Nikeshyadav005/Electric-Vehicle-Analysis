Electric Vehicle Market Analysis using Power BI

I'm excited to share my recent data analytics project on Electric Vehicles!

In this project, I analyzed the growth and trends of electric vehicles (EVs) using a rich dataset of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The key insights include:

Total EVs on the road (BEV + PHEV)

Average electric range of EVs

EV growth over the years (2010 onwards)

State-wise distribution of EVs

Top 10 makes and models

CAFV eligibility analysis

Tools Used: Excel 2021, Power BI (Dec 2023)

This dashboard helped visualize adoption trends and market share of EVs across different regions and models.
